("Coaching - Foundation","Selective","Coaching is a form of development in which an experienced person, called a coach, supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance. The learner is sometimes called a coachee. \nOccasionally, coaching may mean an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the latter learns; \n but coaching differs from mentoring by focusing on specific tasks or objectives, as opposed to more general goals or overall development.

("Interview Skills - Foundation","Elective","An interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given. \n In common parlance, the word interview refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee. The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually so information may be transferred from interviewee to interviewer (and any other audience of the interview). \n Sometimes, information can be transferred in both directions. It is a communication, unlike a speech, which produces a one-way flow of information.","https://www.pluralsight.com/"),

("Apprentice Development Program","Mandatory","An apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading).
